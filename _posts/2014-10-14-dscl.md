A long time ago I wrote [some DSCL instructions](http://www.macos.utah.edu/documentation/authentication/dscl.html).  I may eventually update it and put it on this page someday.  Alas, there is a lot of other documentation out there now so maybe I wont.

Here are a few notes that I wanted to keep that aren't on the above website.

#### Non-interactive commands

Here is how I can list person’s account.

    dscl /Search -read /Users/james

If I am unsure what accounts exist, I can get a list with this command.

    dscl /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 -list /Users

If I want to see a list of all LDAP and local users (dslocal) I can replace "/LDAPv3/127.0.0.1” with “/Search”

    dscl /Search -list /Users
