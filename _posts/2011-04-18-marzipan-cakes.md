Marzipan is an icing made from almond paste and sugar. I used to get a white cake with raspberry and cream filling from a Scandinavian bakery called Scandia Kaffe House, which had the best marzipan cakes ever. Scandia closed. I found a good replacement at the [Granite Bakery](http://granitebakery.com/).

Granite Bakery has a cake that is very similar to the one from Scandia and they even told me that theirs was kind of a copy of Scandia's (I don't think they said copy, but whatever). I got one last year and it was pretty good. They are at 902 East and 2700 South, which is actually about a mile and a half down the street from where Scandia was.

I'm mainly posting this entry so that I don't forget the name of the new place the next time I want a marzipan cake because this year I did forget and I got one from [Schmidt's Pastry Cottage](http://www.schmidtspastry.net/). It is a white cake with raspberry and cream filling like the others, but the raspberry and cream layers were really thin and it wasn't as moist. Schmidt's has been a favorite of mine for their german chocolate iced cookies and mint iced brownies. But they aren't my favorite maker of marzipan cakes.
