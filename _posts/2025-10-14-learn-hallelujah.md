I first learned the "*Hallelujah*" Chorus in high school choir. I assumed it was so difficult only professionals could sing it so I was surprised that I actually learned it and sang it in high school. I still have a reverence for this music today, but my attitude is quite the opposite. I feel that everyone should try to learn it because it's such a remarkable experience. As such, I'm creating this webpage with information on how to sing it.

Most of this page is links to practice videos and other resources.

## The Music

It's public domain.

- [WORDS ONLY](dl/Hallelujah%20Chorus.pdf) (for people who can't read music--[instructions](#nosheetmusic) below.)
- [Hallelujah Chorus](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/41602/hfhg) sheet music
- [*Messiah*](https://s9.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/6/6f/IMSLP11870-Handel_Messiah_Schirmer_1912.pdf) full score (this is a large file). The Hallelujah Chorus is No. 44. It's pages 203 - 213 (written page 193 - 203).

## Practice Tracks

Here are links to various recordings and resources. I've organized them by vocal part.

If you don't know what part you are, the general rule is that if you are female and have a high voice, you're soprano, otherwise your alto. If you're male and have a high voice you're tenor, otherwise you're bass.

Note, the Hallelujah Chorus goes very high, especially at the end. Even if you think you sing high, you might want to sing the lower parts or stop singing when it gets too high.

## If You Can't Read Music

Just sing the melody!

Download [Words Only](dl/Hallelujah%20Chorus.pdf).

There are 8 sections in this piece: the beginning and sections marked with rehearsal marks A to G. As you read these instructions try singing with a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rf3WK_IJ1g). Pause it as you get to each new section so you can read the next instructions. Then start over until you can do it without having to pause.

#### Beginning Section

Sing joyously and loudly but not at full volume. Save your loudest singing for the climax at the end. And never sing so loud that you can't hear the people around you.

About the word Hallelujah. It has 4 syllables, and different people have different ideas on which one should be the strongest. But everyone agrees that "jah" at the end is **never** strong. Most of the time it should be **Hal**-le-lu-jah.

#### Section A

This section starts 2 measures before rehearsal mark A.

Pronounce "omnipotent" like this: Awem-knee-poh-tent. Awem like "awe" with an m at the end. Knee, like what's on your leg. Poh like "potato". Tent, like the thing you go camping in.

#### Section B

You have 3 choices.

Don't sing this part.

Sing the melody, "For the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth." It repeats 3 times and different voices sing it each time.

Or use the Practice Track links above (in particular the rehearsal track) to learn it.

#### Section C

Sing quietly until the word "become". "Become" gets louder. By the time you get to "the Kingdom," you should be loud again. But this isn't the loudest part, so still save some volume for later.

#### Section D

This is like section B. Either don't sing, sing just the melody, or use the practice tracks to learn your part.

#### Section E

This repeats a pattern 3 times. The first time the women sing "King of Kings and Lord of Lords" and the men sing "For ever and ever. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!".

The second time is the same except the altos sing with the men.

The third time is the same except for one very critical part.
 
- Sopranos: "King of Kings,"
- Men and altos: "For ever and ever. Hallelujah! Hal-le-**lu**-jah!" (Hold the "lu"!*)
- Sopranos: "and Lord of Lords, and Lord of Lords."
- Men and altos: "King of Kings, and Lord of Lords"

\* Hold the "lu" when you get to the "Halle**lu**jah." If you miss this you'll stick out like a sore thumb!!! Don't feel bad though, it happens to everyone.

#### Section F

This section begins quieter.

The first 5 measures is like sections B and D. Either don't sing or use the practice tracks.

But then everyone comes in and gets loud at "King of Kings"!

#### Section G

This is the climax! Sing as loud as you can (but not so loud you can't hear other people).

Watch at the very end. Conductors throw the tempo away and do it very slowly.
